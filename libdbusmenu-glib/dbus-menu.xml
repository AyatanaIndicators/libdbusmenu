<!-- Functions -->

<!--
Returns the list of items which are children of @a parentId.

@param parentid unsigned the parent id for the list. If it is 0, returns the root
item list;
@param propertyNames list of string the list of item properties we are interested in

An item is represented as a struct following this format:
@li id unsigned the item id
@li properties map(string => variant) the requested item properties

-->
		<method name="GetChildren">
			<arg type="u" name="parentId" direction="in" />
			<arg type="as" name="propertyNames" direction="in" />
			<arg type="a(ua{sv})" name="children" direction="out" />
		</method>

<!--
Each menu item has a set of properties. Property keys are in menuitem.h:

@li type string Type of the item (see below)
@li label string Text of the item
@li icon-data binary Raw data of the icon (TODO: define format)
@li icon string Icon name of the item, following icon spec
@li sensitive boolean Whether the item can be activated or not
@li visible boolean Whether the item is visible or not (XXX: Is this necessary?)
@li checked boolean Whether a checkbox or radio item is checked
@li shortcut string The keyboard shortcut

@c type property is an enum which can take the following values (client.h):

@li action An item which can be clicked to trigger an action
@li checkbox An item which can be checked or unchecked
@li radio An item which can be checked or unchecked as part of a group
@li separator A separator
@li menu An item which contains more items
-->
		<method name="GetProperty">
			<arg type="u" name="id" direction="in" />
			<arg type="s" name="name" direction="in" />
			<arg type="v" name="value" direction="out" />
		</method>

<!--
Returns multiple properties in one call. This is more efficient than
GetProperty.

@param id unsigned the item whose properties we want to retrieve.
@param propertyNames list of string name of the properties we want.
-->
		<method name="GetProperties">
			<annotation name="com.trolltech.QtDBus.QtTypeName.Out0" value="QVariantMap"/>
			<arg type="u" name="id" direction="in" />
			<arg type="as" name="propertyNames" direction="in" />
			<arg type="a{sv}" name="properties" direction="out" />
		</method>

<!--
This is called by the applet to notify the application an event happened on a
menu item.

@param id the id of the item which received the event
@param type the type of event
@param data event-specific data

@a type can be one of the following:

@li "clicked"
@li "hovered"

Vendor specific events can be added by prefixing them with "x-<vendor>-"
-->
		<method name="Event">
			<arg type="u" name="id" direction="in" />
			<arg type="s" name="eventId" direction="in" />
			<arg type="v" name="data" direction="in" />
		</method>

<!-- Signals -->
<!--
Triggered by the application to notify the applet that the property @a property
from item @a id has changed to @a value.
-->
		<signal name="ItemPropertyUpdated">
			<arg type="u" name="id" direction="out" />
			<arg type="s" name="prop" direction="out" />
			<arg type="v" name="value" direction="out" />
		</signal>

<!--
Triggered by the application to notify the applet that all properties of item
@a id should be considered outdated
-->
		<signal name="ItemUpdated">
			<arg type="u" name="id" direction="out" />
		</signal>

<!--
Triggered by the application to notify applet it should retrieve the children
for item @a id.
-->
		<signal name="ChildrenUpdated">
			<arg type="u" name="id" direction="out" />
		</signal>
