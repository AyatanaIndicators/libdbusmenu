	Adding in a massive debugging flag for generating massive debugging.

2009-09-30  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Adding a print out.  But it still passses.

2009-09-30  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Making a bunch of reordering tests.  No fails.

	Ignoring generated test scripts

2009-09-30  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Cleaning up the tests so that they run and check their values in a friendly way.

2009-09-30  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Not sure what this test was supposed to do, but it creates some items.  Could be a good property test.  Anyway, now it exits.

2009-10-02  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Checking on error so that we don't access invalid hash tables.

2009-10-02  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	We weren't checking to see if error wasn't null, and therefore we reacted on a bad hashtable which caused a crash.

2009-09-24  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Incrementing the version number

2009-09-24  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Updating the signal to send a revision number

2009-09-17  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Adding in a second checking of the layout if we look for it while we're still requesting it.  We're not sure if this creates an issue between the syncing of the two objects.

2009-09-17  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Adding in handling of the child moved event

2009-09-17  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Setting version to 0.1.4

2009-09-11  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Applying a fix by not blocking if we're calling for the root.  Everyone should be listening for root changes anyway.

2009-09-11  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Commenting out the blocking on root waiting for an update.

2009-09-10  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Wild and crazy 0.1.3

2009-09-10  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Merging in a fix for reordering entries in the GTK menu object.  And some comments.

2009-09-09  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Some comments and when a root item is realized we're reordering it right away.  This makes a lot more sense.

2009-09-09  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Some comments as I'm looking through the code.

2009-09-03  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Version 0.1.2

2009-09-03  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Casting the gsize to an int for 64-bit systems.  We shouldn't have pngs over 4 GB anyway.  Wonder how dbus would handle it...

2009-09-03  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Up to 0.1.1

2009-09-03  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Merging in support for image items.  Including encoding and decoding the images across DBus.

2009-09-03  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Adding precidence testing.  The name should be over the data.  Here the data is the opposite of the name.  So if the name matches the icon, we're right.

2009-09-03  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Put some data tests in there.

2009-09-03  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Moving the checking on the data set on whether we have a name earlier.  We don't want to change anything if we've got a name already.  Return early.

2009-09-03  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Fixing some string checking.  Truth is a bitch.

2009-09-03  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Switching to setting the label initially seems to make everything better.  Go figure.

2009-09-02  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Adding in an icon name test.  We fail it.

2009-09-02  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	A couple more comments.

2009-09-02  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Fleshing out the image property handler.

2009-09-02  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Some comments in gtk-doc style.

2009-09-02  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Fleshing out the get function again stealing code from libindicate-gtk.

2009-09-02  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Fleshing out the setting function.  Stealing from libindicate.

2009-09-02  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Basic support for the sensitive property.

2009-08-27  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Increasing the version to 0.1.0 because of a miscommunication about what the next version will be.  The next version will be 0.1.1

2009-08-27  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Merging in the branch to add a simple type system to dbusmenu and use it to make a better GTK library, including showing and hiding items.

2009-08-27  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Checking the menu is a GTK menu before casting it.  Comments by Neil.

2009-08-27  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Adding checks to the type handling functions in GTK+ version of the lib.  Comments by Neil.

2009-08-27  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Making sure that type is not NULL.  Comment from Neil.

2009-08-27  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Check the return of g_new0 for NULL.  Comment by Neil.

2009-08-27  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Comment for Neil.  Checking data.

	Adding a public accessor for getting the gtk client

2009-08-26  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Promoting the base function up to an API function so that it can be used else where.

2009-08-26  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	We're going to need a new version for this change.

2009-08-26  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Having new children processed on realization

2009-08-26  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Adding in a default type handler, incase it's configured, but not set by clients.

2009-08-26  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Making some separator tests and a visibility one as well.

2009-08-26  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Centralize visiblity processing and changes to the prop value.

2009-08-26  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

2009-08-26  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Spelling fix.

2009-08-26  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Making a separator

2009-08-26  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Use the label Luke! It helps.

2009-08-26  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Instead of directly appending items, make it so that they're not connected until they're realized.

2009-08-26  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Adding a warning, showing the widget and moving the new signal to ensure everything is setup first

2009-08-25  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Adding a type of 'menuitem' on all of these.

2009-08-25  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Ah, bother.  Check NULL.  Brain fart.

2009-08-25  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Now we're building the child/parent relationship using the activation type function.

2009-08-25  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	It turns out that when you define functions in a header file, they don't just write themselves from your thoughts.  Who's supposed to tell me these things?  Anyway, now we have a way to register type handlers, like the header file said we should.

2009-08-25  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Forgot some signal documentation.

2009-08-25  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Switching the prototype for type handlers so that it passes the client as well.

2009-08-25  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Code reshuffle.  Now a warning on new items and fleshing out the type-based functions.

2009-08-25  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Okay, building in some type handlers now.

2009-08-25  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Signaling the realized event after it has all it's parameters.

2009-08-25  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Creating a realized signal on the menu items.

2009-08-20  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Making things a little more type safe.  Only one evil cast.

2009-08-20  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Makin' it so that if we have a type handler we use that, otherwise we pass things up.  Also making it so that type handlers can report an error.

2009-08-20  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Seems intltool changed slightly

2009-08-20  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Switching the new signal to be after the properties are gotten and adding a hashtable for type handlers.

2009-08-20  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	AM 1.11 silence

2009-08-04  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Merging in the development branches

2009-07-20  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Heh, turns out we need to actually signal people across DBus or nothing works.  Who'd a thought.

2009-07-20  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Print on click

2009-07-01  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Bad prototype for dealing with the new items added signal which also has the position in it.  This made it so the server was the position, which causes bad stuff to happen.

2009-07-01  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Adding a really simple test to add items to a stack.

2009-06-26  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Hiding a debug message

2009-06-26  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Wait for the signal about the root changing instead of forcing it here.  It'll have to change from the beginning state that we just had it in.  And since we're singled threaded ther was no way for it to change in those few lines of code.

2009-06-26  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Removing the old is_root and now using the new property on the menuitems for that task.

2009-06-26  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Add the property of the menuitems to check to see if they're the root node or not.  Also set that when the layout is being parsed.

2009-06-26  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Switching the loss of the proxies to be warnings instead of errors as we can recover from it and handle it gracefully if we need to.

2009-06-26  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Flipping arround the original update of the layout to be after building the proxies, not something driven by new.  Also ensuring that the callback pointer is reset when we're in it so that it doesn't get called recursively.

2009-06-25  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Ignoring more tests files.

2009-06-25  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	For some reason the kill switch was missing on this one.  Weird.

2009-06-25  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Some debug messages and a forcing the initial root reset at the start.

2009-06-25  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Okay, now we have these guys doing something, let's roll.

2009-06-25  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Fleshing out the root changed function, but that's led to another couple that need to get figured out as well.

2009-06-25  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Make it so that getting the menuitem will create it in cases where it's not created.  This removes the chance of a race between the various functions.

2009-06-25  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Making it so that we don't have any gtk events or handling of the root node.  It's a special node, we need to leave it alone.

2009-06-25  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Adding the client to the child related functions

2009-06-25  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Merging in the updated gtkmenu branch with tests.

2009-06-25  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Merging in Ara's work on getting us some gtkmenu tests in mago.  Woo hoo.  Now some real tests.

2009-06-25  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Changing the clean rule to be distclean-local which makes more sense.

2009-06-25  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Removing the built python directory and destroying the mago results.

2009-06-25  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Making it so that we don't distribute the .xml and .py file, but build them everytime.

2009-06-25  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Adding a results directory to the command line.

2009-06-25  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Getting the rest of the files added into the dist tarball.

2009-06-25  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Changing the python script to be generated so that it can get the paths correctly.  It's almost making Python into a real language.  Not quite, but getting there.

2009-06-25  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Adding in a python path to pick up the module

2009-06-25  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Update from Ara

	Fixed mago-integration

2009-06-25  Ara Pulido  <ara@ubuntu.com>

	Merged from mago-integration

2009-06-24  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Building the xml file on the fly.

2009-06-24  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	We're going to change the xml file to be a built file so that the paths are all correct.

2009-06-24  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	starting to get mago into the test architecture

2009-06-24  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Merging in Ara's work on the Mago tests for libdbusmenu

2009-06-24  Ara Pulido  <ara@ubuntu.com>

	Added mago tests for dbusmenu-gtk

2009-06-22  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Merging in the 'legal' branch with a bunch of copyright messages and such.  I think this brings us up to speed there.

2009-06-25  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Ignoring the client binary

2009-06-24  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Some comments for the gtk-doc stuff

2009-06-24  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Handling the differing signals to set things up with the various gtk widgets

2009-06-24  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Major reshuffling, not quite done, but compiles.

2009-06-23  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Getting rid of code.  We don't need properties or to build a cleint.  I mean, we are one :)

2009-06-23  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Okay, now we're rebuilding this client thingy.

2009-06-23  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Switching some of the client naming stuff to make everything stick together.

2009-06-23  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Okay, being a little funny with how these things are playing out.  Missing subversion's crazy everything is a copy semantics right now.  It works well for stuff like this.

2009-06-23  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Signaling on root changes.

2009-06-23  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Signaling the new menuitem.

2009-06-23  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Adding two new signals to the client.  'root-changed' and 'new-menuitem' to make it so that this can go up the stack easier.

2009-06-23  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Now we're also signalling when a child gets moved around.

2009-06-23  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Adding in the 'moved' signal and make it so that the 'added' signal has the position in it.

2009-06-23  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Getting the legal headers and stuff.

2009-06-18  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Putting GPLv3 on some of these that were missing it.

2009-06-18  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Putting LGPL headers on these.

2009-06-18  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	These should be LGPL v3/2.1

2009-06-18  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Pulling in the GTK code

2009-06-23  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Removing test-gtk-label.h

2009-06-17  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

2009-06-05  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Updates from trunk with the properites branch.

2009-06-18  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Making it so that if we clear the menu structure by destroying the proxies we also signal that to the callers.

2009-06-18  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Handle the server removing itself from the bus and putting us into a dark world waiting for it to rejoin the world.

2009-06-18  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	If we can't get a proxy on the stuff that we want, we're going to set up a DBus one and just wait for it to show up.  When it showes up, then we'll pounce

2009-06-18  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Handling the concept of not having a property proxy.

2009-06-05  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Updating to have the gtkmenu stuff

2009-05-27  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Pointer casts make the 64-bit builds unhappy.

2009-05-26  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Same cut and paste bug, you'd think I'd be smart enough to check this when I fixed the last one.  Dumbass.

2009-05-26  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Adding a reorder and prepend convience functions so that they emit the right signals.

2009-05-26  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Too many values on signal

2009-05-25  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Debug fix

2009-05-25  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

2009-05-25  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Unref'ing root when we dispose

2009-05-25  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

2009-05-25  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Bother, truth is so fickle in that it is so binary in wanting correctness.

2009-05-25  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Switching to the right header and updating the properties more.

	Starting to verify the properties

2009-05-19  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Starting to flesh out more of this DBus stuff

2009-05-15  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Reworking the DBus interface slightly.  Making it so that the properties are now sent in a dict and that there isn't an arbitrary listing of things.  It's either grab all or grab one.  Seems to apply to the use cases better.

2009-05-12  Ted Gould  <ted@canonical.com>

	Okay, now we have a lifecycle for all of our nifty signal handlers.  Kinda crazy that we're building all of these suckers.  Recursive setting all hidden in a nifty little function.
